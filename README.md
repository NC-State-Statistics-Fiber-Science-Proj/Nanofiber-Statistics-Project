# PEO-Nanofiber-Project
This project was carried out to evaluate and address (1) if manually measured nanofibers taken from a larger piece of non-woven mats are statistically significant between the  location from which they are taken (location-effect) and (2) if if there is a statistical variations if measured by different analysts (analyst-effect). 
The key importance of the project lies in the effect that most of the measurements are done manually and some polymeric nanofibers demonstrate higher standard deviation from the mean values.
