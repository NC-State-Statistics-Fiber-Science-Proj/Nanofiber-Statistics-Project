# PEO-Nanofiber-Project
This project was carried out to evaluate and address (1) if manually measured nanofibers taken from a larger piece of non-woven mats are statistically significant between the  location from which they are taken (location-effect) and (2) if if there is a statistical variations if measured by different analysts (analyst-effect).    
The key importance of the project lies in the effect that most of the measurements are done manually and some polymeric nanofibers demonstrate higher standard deviation from the mean values. 
This project has been peer-reviewed and published as a manuscript. Full description of the manuscript can be found in the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142941817301976#tbl1
Statistical analyses of the datasets, including SAS-codes and raw data sets, are provided in this repository.
